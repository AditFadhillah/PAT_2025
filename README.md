# Program Analysis and Transformation (PAT)

This is the official repository for the **Program Analysis and Transformation (PAT)** course, offered as part of the MSc Programme in Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen.

## Course Overview

The PAT course introduces students to the principles and practice of automated program processing. It covers both mainstream applications and selected advanced topics, with an emphasis on static analysis and semantics-based transformation techniques.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will:

### Knowledge

- Understand static program analysis paradigms, including abstract interpretation and type-based analysis.
- Recognize application areas such as optimization, verification, and information security.
- Grasp the principles of semantics-based program transformation.
- Learn about software systems and tools that support program analysis and transformation.
- Explore examples of advanced analyses and transformations.

### Skills

- Argue correctness and properties of analysis and transformation algorithms.
- Implement analysis and transformation algorithms from abstract descriptions.

### Competences

- Design and implement systems for automated processing of programs, in both general-purpose and domain-specific languages.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of programming language implementation (e.g., a basic compilers course)
- Familiarity with operational semantics and type systems (e.g., "Semantics and Types")
- Proficiency in a functional programming language, such as Haskell

## Course Format

- **Lectures**: 20 hours  
- **Exercises**: 60 hours  
- **Project Work**: 100 hours  
- **Preparation**: 26 hours  
- **Total Workload**: 206 hours  
- **Credits**: 7.5 ECTS  
- **Language**: English  
- **Assessment**: Continuous assessment based on 4–6 individual assignments combining theory and programming  
- **Grading**: 7-point Danish scale  
- **Re-exam**: Resubmission of assignments and a 30-minute oral exam
